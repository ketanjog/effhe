# Effhe - a privacy preserving protocol for encrypted neural network inference

EffHE is a client-server model in which the client is responsible for performing the non-linear calculations, while the server performs all the linear calculations. We have provided a proof- of-concept implementation of EffHE built upon TenSEAL, a nascent framework integrating homomorphic encryption with PyTorch.
